                <!--Short Introduction-->
                <h4>


                    <strong>Over</strong> the last few weeks I have been buckling down with Salum to start data collection and finish final optimization changes for the Smelly Socks Project . Up until a few days ago we were running daily experiments, which was a significant improvement over our past rate of once every other week. By running more experiments, we were able to make small configuration changes to the machine producing more reliable and repeatable results. So far, we have used chicken feathers, our fingers, and dog hair to be the bait attracting the mosquitos and hope to move to using smelly socks soon.<br />
                    <br />However, our latest problem is not with the olfactometer but with our lab-bred mosquito supply. A problem with IHI’s mosquito colonies has stopped our work dead in its tracks. I was told that we have lost half the mosquito population (roughly 14,000 adult mosquitos) and all experiments are being postponed until the colonies are back to their usual sizes. Without mosquitos to run our tests, we are at a standstill with our work. I am not sure what is causing the mosquitos to die, but it is becoming a big problem for some of the ongoing experiments at IHI.<br />

                    <br />Below: A sample of the dead Mosquito colony<br />

                    <br /> Most of my time over the last few weeks has been spent working in the lab and avoiding the constant downpour the rainy season brings. The soccer field and roads are under water and unless one of my friends has a 4x4 vehicle or canoe, I mostly stick around the office and my house.<br />
                    <br />Luckily, the more experienced Tanzanian residents are equipped for everything here in Ifakara. Gerry, an Irish scientist who has lived here the last 19 years of his life shared his family Easter tradition with me last week. This tradition involves taking his Land Cruiser through the road/river 4 hours south to an ornithology camp. I didn’t understand why Gerry’s exhaust system was being released at the top of his truck instead of underneath until we drove through some puddles that came up to our windows. I think I counted 6 cars/trucks that were stuck as we drove past, but eventually we made it to the ornithology camp dry and in one piece.<br />
                    <br />We woke up on Easter morning for a 5 hour bird spotting expedition. We got very wet during this but I have learned that’s just a part of living here in the rainy season. The birds, however, were fantastic. We saw toucans, parrots, and a dozen other birds I didn’t recognize but were beautiful. Gerry’s kids knew practically everything there was to know about Tanzanian birds so I had excellent guides.<br />

                    <br /> Here is a picture of us in the bush during the rainy season.<br />

                    <br />  Lastly, here are some pictures from the last few weeks.<br />


                    <br /> -When it is sunny, work stops and we go for a sit outside. Here are my friends Salum and Manuu enjoying the sunny weather<br />

                    <br /> -I was able to visit school last week and it was a great experience. All the kids wanted to speak English with me and I was invited back for sports Friday<br />

                    <br /> -After a few rain delays, I was able to play in the Ifakara cup with the IHI futball team. We lost in the semi-finals to Tigo, but it was still a fun time<br />
