                    Why I'm Here
                    <small>An Introduction</small>
                </h1>

                <!--Short Introduction-->
                <h4>
                    <strong>This</strong> post is to answer why I'm 8361.861 miles away from home, and what led me here to the hidden yet bustling city of Ifakara, Tanzania. I will try to sum up how I decided on living in Tanzania for the next half year of my life in a few paragraphs, but this process took me almost a year to decide on. I had many factors that were playing into this decision and just as many other places I was considering on spending my time at. Now that I’m finally here, I am thankful I put as much time as I did into deciding where to go, but pulling the trigger on going to a place where the main language is Swahili and the average yearly temperature was 28°C (82°F) was not the easiest call. <br />

                    <br /> Back home I work apart of a lab that employs students from all over the world. This lab, the GasDay lab, brings very smart people together to work on a natural gas prediction application that Marquette University sells to utilities across the US. At the GasDay lab, I was able to meet and befriend students that for the most part English was their second or even sometimes third language. Two of these students in particular were from Tanzania and I was able to learn about their home and what led them to work towards gaining their masters or PHD. Back home in Tanzania, these students were apart of a health institute that combated the deadly diseases found in their hometowns and villages. Specifically, Malaria was one of their main areas of concentration. I had already known about Malaria and the deadly affect this disease can have on people if not treated. I however did not know the science behind how this disease is transmitted between mosquito to person or the behind the scenes steps the parasite took to invade the immune system of its victims . These two students presented seminars on the work they were conducting but I still never really considered the possibility that I could have an influence in their area of work.<br />

                    <br />I knew I wanted to study abroad even before entering college but had no idea where. When I  started to address the where question, I had many factors that shaped my decision. I wanted to go somewhere new, fun and exciting but also presented an opportunity to work somewhere similar to the GasDay lab to gain the experience of working in a different environment. I spoke about this with one of my mentors who also worked at the lab and he brought up the point that I had a arsenal of connections to labs across the world via my peers who I worked with. One connection in particular seems like the opportunity I had just described to him.<br />

                    <br /> Fast forward to January 16th, 2017. I’m sitting on a plane by myself headed to Ifakara, Tanzania to carry out research and promotion of the ongoing projects at the Ifakara Health Institute. I was under the impression I would be carrying out some web development for the institute, but after being here a week I am excited to get my hands dirty with the numerous experiments and possibilities they have in mind for the next six months. Keep up with my blog posts to find what I’ve been up to.<br />
