                <!--Short Introduction-->
                <h4>
                    <strong>This</strong> blog post will include both weeks 3 and 4. Over the past two weeks I have finished settling in and I am getting used to living in Ifakara. I have spent most of my time working on the several projects IHI has introduced me to and am learning how best to contribute to them. Due to the Smell Machine project being held up by the need for new parts, I have been able to jump on several other ongoing projects. Through these new projects I have done everything from catching wild mosquitos in the rice fields at sunset to calibrating a mid-infrared reflectance spectrometer. Most of these tasks require someone to train me for about 1-2 days, but they are teaching me quickly and I am achieving more independence with the work they give each day.<br />

                    <br />I am most excited about working with the mid-infrared reflectance spectrometer. This tool will hopefully be the answer to a common problem in the field of malaria research. A main part of the research conducted here for several projects is to analyze mosquitos and determine what species/gender/age they are, what type of blood the mosquitos feed on (human, cow, dog…), and whether or not they hold the malaria parasite. Finding these answers require dissection experts, microscopes, blood samples and a lab to test them in. Overall it is a very expensive and time consuming process and why IHI has taken up the project with the spectrometer. If the spectrometer is trained correctly and we are able to “teach” this machine what each type of mosquito looks like, we would be eliminating the need for all this equipment while also cutting down the time it takes to find these answers by 95%. This project started well before I arrived, but I am still very excited to be a part of it. As I was being trained to use this machine, I was told that if IHI were able to get this spectrometer functional it would be revolutionary to this area of malaria research.<br />

                    <br />After work and on the weekends I have been keeping busy with a group of friends I recently met. One of the last things I would have guessed I’d be invited to in Ifakara would be a pizza party. There are no pizzerias in town and from what I have experienced so far is that people here tend to stick to the traditional foods, which definitely doesn’t include pizza. So when I got the invitation last weekend I was excited to check it out. My new Australian friend Jack had built his own pizza oven on his driveway and takes a lot of pride in his pizza-making abilities.<br />

                <h4>
                    <br />Besides the great pizza Jack made, I found that the company at the party was also a lucky find. As I said in a past post, I made many new friends at work by sharing some movies I brought along. However, many of these friends have families and often live far away from IHI, so the institute is quieter on the weekends. By connecting with this group of people that stick around on the weekends, I have been much busier and have found that there is always has something going on within this group.<br />

                    <br />An example of one of these things would be my recent trip to a sandbar. Yesterday we planned a 30 km bike ride into the countryside of Tanzania. It was a great day for a ride and we left around 11am. Most of my other friends were on mountain bikes with large tires while I was on the road bike pictured in week 2’s post. I was able to handle the sand alright and kept up with everyone relatively well. What ended up slowing me down was that around kilometer 16 my left bike pedal and arm snapped off. This was an issue as we were in the middle of nowhere with no people around but a few rice farmers who didn’t have tools.<br />

                <h4>
                    <br />Luckily I was riding with mostly engineers and we found that if we put the arm back in place and packed straw and mud around its socket, I was able to ride about 300 – 400 yards before it would fall off again. Thankfully I had brought plenty of water so I was able to make mud to repack the socket for the rest of the ride back, but it ended up making our ride last about 5 hours. All in all, the ride and sandbar were beautiful and I don’t regret going, despite the sunburn and exhaustion. There is already another ride planned for next weekend and I hope to have my bike fixed by then.<br />
